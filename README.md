# Jraphics
## A simple 3D Engine made in Java

This engine allows you to render any .obj file using basic Java Swing libraries. 

The mesh has to be made only of triangles since the engine is incapable of rendering quads. 

Currently there's no public library aviable so it's hard to use it in your own project but I' ll try to implement and share one soon for public use. 

See this as a recreational project, it's probably not optimized enough, but it has culling, clipping, and a basic camera implementation.
